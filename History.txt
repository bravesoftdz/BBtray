BBTRAY HISTORY
--------------

2001/11/26 - v0.9.1 - Bug Fix: Now you can use SSL *with* password protection.
                      Thanks, Jeff Stoner.

2001/11/12 - v0.9   - New: Programmable strings on tray icon's hint (HintString)
                      and on popup window (PopupString). See bbtray.ini for
                      details.

                    - Removed: URLOnHint option. You can simulate it by
                      setting HintString=%C: %U. See above.

                    - New: No more need to start one bbtray.exe for each section
                      of bbtray.ini. It will be done automagically by the first
                      bbtray started.

                    - New: Support for SSL (https). Check Readme.txt

                    - New: Changed the bbtray.exe's icon. Thanks Martin Parrott.

2001/06/20 - v0.8.3 - Bug Fix: Indy does not handles the http://user:pass@host
                      syntax... sic :( Now it should work properly. Thanks
                      Michael Beer and Martin Lathoud for testing it.

2001/05/25 - v0.8   - New: Icons shown on the tray can now be changed using the
                      new IconsPath option on the INI file. See BBTRAY.INI
                      for details.

                    - Changed the underlying HTTP code from WININET.DLL to Indy
                      (http://www.nevrona.com/Indy/). I think we'll get less
                      'Access Violations' from now on.

2001/02/07 - v0.7   - Bug Fix: Sound problem on NT/2000 fixed. No more Access
                      Violations when sounds should be played.

2000/12/?? - v0.6 UNRELEASED - Pressing <Enter> on the Popup window starts
                      the browser, the same as clicking on the window. And now
                      this window closes when clicked or <Enter> is pressed.

2000/08/02 - v0.5   - New: URLOnHint. Show the URL of the BBDISPLAY page on the
                      tray hint, instead of its title. Useful when runing multiple
                      instances of BBtray.

                    - Changed the name of some options of the INI file: SoundsPath
                      instead of SoundsURL and PollFrequency instead of PoolTime.
                      But BBtray is backwards compatible ;)

                    - Changed the colored tray icon. It will be customizable in
                      the next version

2000/03/31 - v0.4   - New: Proxy configuration! See BBTRAY.INI for details

                    - New: SoundsURL can now be a local path, for per-station
                      customization of sounds. Thanks Adam Goryachev.

                    - New: HTTP authentication. See BBTRAY.INI for details

                    - Changed the example soundfiles set.

2000/03/28 - v0.3   - Bug fix: No more Access Violation on startup when running on
                      Windows NT/2000.

                    - Bug fix: The in-line comments on the example INI file were
                      confusing BBtray. Changed INI file and added some protection
                      inside the program.

                    - New Ini Option: PopupLevels defines the colors that should
                      popup the warning window.

2000/03/27 - v0.2   - Code overhauled.

                    - Added support for more then one BBDISPLAY (see the comments
                      on the BBTRAY.INI).

                    - Put all messages on the INI file, making possible the
                      customization/translation of it.

                    - Clicking on the popup warning window should now open the
                      BBDISPLAY page with your default browser (the same as
                      double-clicking the tray icon).

2000/03/24 - v0.1   - Added support for external (.ini) configuration.

                    - First release to {bb} mailing list, trying to help
                      Meredith Peruzzi.

1999/11/** - v0.0   - Initial version(s).

                    - Not released to my Brothers, only used inside
                      the company I work for.

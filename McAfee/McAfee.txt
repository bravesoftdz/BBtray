At least for versions 4.0.70 for the engine, and 4.0.4088 for the dat files, 
McAfee VirusScan warns that BBtray is infected with QDEL110 virus. 
It's a false alarm!!

After contacting NAI here in Brasil, they have sent me an 'Extra.dat' file 
(included with BBtray distribution) that, when put in the same directory where 
the others .dat files reside, disable this false alarm. 

For more details, search the archives of BB mailing list or send an email to me.
